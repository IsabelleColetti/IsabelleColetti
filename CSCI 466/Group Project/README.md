An online store created with HTML, PHP, and SQL.

# Customer-side
Allows a customer to create an account for the store. Customers can view all products in stock along with a description, add products to their cart, purchase products in their cart, and view their order details and status.

# Employee-side
Allows an employee to log into their account for the store. Employees can view inventory, view orders and order details, assign orders to themselves, add notes to orders, and ship orders.

All source code is mine and my group's.
